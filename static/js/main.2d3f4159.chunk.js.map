Yes, shepherds were told about the birth by angels\n          and wise men followed the new star.  Of course his mother and\n          Joseph knew as well.  But for the majority of people in Israel, the night\n          Christ was born was probably a night just like many others.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This was not the case in the Americas, the sign announcing Christ's birth wasn't just a new \n          star, it was also a day and a night and a day without any darkness.\n          The night of Christ's birth here was filled with unspeakable light.  The believers knew \n          this was the sign that Christ had been born.  Many who had not previously believed,\n          gained new faith and were baptized.  This was important because the\n          wicked people who lived in the Americas, knew of the\n          prophecy concerning the birth of Christ, and had decided to kill all\n          believers if the sign did not come true by a certain day.  We can read in the\n          Book of Mormon how a prophet prayed for deliverance and the voice of\n          the Lord came to him saying:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          \"Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at\n          hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow\n          come I into the world...\" (3 Nephi 1:13)\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When the sign came as a day, a night, and a day as if they were one\n          day, even the wicked could not deny it.  From the night of\n          His birth, Christ was saving his people, quite literally.  The\n          righteous were saved because light filled the sky on\n          the night of Christ's birth.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Just like the believers in the Americas, we can focus on Christ\n          despite the circumstances, struggles, and challenges that surround us.\n          Likewise, giving birth in a stable was surely not Mary's first choice,\n          but it did fulfill prophecy--meaning a way was prepared for her to\n          overcome her challenges.  We hope that as you confront the challenges\n          in your life, just like Mary and Joseph or the believers in the\n          Americas did that night so long ago, you will find a way with the\n          Lord's help to find peace and happiness.  \"Peace I leave with you, my\n          peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  Let\n          not your heart be troubled, neither let if be afraid.\" (John 14:27).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          May the Spirit of Christmas fill you with light.  Whether it be a\n          small light, like a star in a night sky, a brighter light like angels\n          singing in heaven, or a light bright enough to literally change night\n          to day, may His light fill your soul this season.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Warm regards,\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Bishop Jeff Waddell <br />\n          1st Counselor Tom Scott <br />\n          2nd Counselor John Hansen\n        </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <hr />\n\n        <div className=\"foodbank\">\n          <p>\n            Thank you for your donation this evening to the Utah Food Bank.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.utahfoodbank.org/\"><img className=\"foodbank-img\" src={foodbank} alt=\"\" /></a>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n    </header>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
